# Homology Modeling For 3D Protein Structure Prediction

Decoding protein 3D structures from amino acid sequences is imperative for comprehending their functions with applications spanning biochemistry, molecular biology, and drug discovery. The resulting insights aid in drug design, biotechnological engineering, and understanding diseases linked to abnormal protein structures. This process involves three main approaches: ab initio modeling, experimental methods (X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy), and comparative modeling.

Ab initio modeling predicts structures based solely on amino acid sequences, using physics and energy minimization. Experimental methods, while accurate, are costly and time-consuming. In "Template-Based Protein Structure Modeling," Fiser notes the rarity of experimentally known 3D models, emphasizing the need for computational approaches like homology modeling. Our project delves into comparative modeling, predicting a target protein's 3D structure by aligning its sequence with a homologous protein, leveraging shared functions and structures. This exploration responds to the challenges of experimentally determining protein structures, aiming to bridge this gap using computational tools like homology modeling.
